* What is the project idea?
The project is a process management daemon to run on my Linux server, it will help to manage projects, auto-restarting them if they exit as well as providing an API (and possibly web interface) to manage variables, code through git, and the status of the project itself.

** Ok but what does that actually mean?
My artifact will be able to
- Run a process
- Restart it if it fails
- Control the environment varibles the project runs with
- Give an API that lets us
  - Start, stop & restart the project
  - Give information about the project (memory usage, is it started, logs etc.)
  - Pull code from git, either when updated or on command
