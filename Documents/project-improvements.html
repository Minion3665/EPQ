<ul class="org-ul">
<li>More &amp; better ways of getting &amp; evaluating information would be helpful. Right now most of my research comes either from Docker &amp; other companies themselves (which is <i>fine</i>, they are industry experts, but also shows some level of bias towards using docker)</li>
<li>Tracking progress better could be helpful; right now diary entries are not always getting written which will I predict will cause some trouble later on
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It may be possible to backdate <i>some</i> stuff from commit logs, but it won't be possible to give as detailed of diary entries as I would like without writing diary entries at the time, could there be a better way to enforce writing 1-entry-per-week?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More detail could be included in diary entries that are written now</li>
<li>Better timelining could be useful; right now I have 1 timeline but making more detailed intra-month ones and updated inter-month ones could help. My project has changed a bit (see networking issues etc.), so with more information on how long stuff could take new timelines could be made</li>
<li>I'm writing an artefact, so I need a commentary; something akin to this has been started in <a href="../Notes/20220117103708-programming_log.html#ID-956c4043-ffaa-45d6-be32-6219c21ea597">Programming log</a>, but it should probably be moved into its own thing and become more detailed</li>
