This recording is with PineappleFan, someone who will be, on a day-to-day basis, using the code I create in this EPQ, I asked them a question about what features they'd like to see, and I'll be working quite tightly with them and another co-owner later on in the process

Transcript (emphasis mine):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Me: Alright, hi pinea, can you introduce yourself?
</p>

<p>
Pinea: Hello, I am pineapple, I am a programmer and work with minion on different projects
</p>

<p>
Me: and I'm minion, I'm also known as Skyler, and <b>I'm going to ask pineapple a few questions about my EPQ project</b>, so pinea, we've talked a bit about my EPQ project. <b>What kind of features would you like to see in this kind of process manager*</b>
</p>

<p>
Pinea: So, some of the main things which I guess others don't have is <b>integration with git: easy pushing, checking for updates, automatically starting back up and taking backups of that when needed and just easy environmental variables</b> would be great
</p>

<p>
Me: Ok, so you think you'd like <b>better ways of communicating with the services we use to host our code, and better ways of managing the production state</b> so variables and databases and stuff like that
</p>

<p>
Pinea: Exactly
</p>

<p>
Me: Alright great, and thank you
</p>
