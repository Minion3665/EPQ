* Evaluating how my project can be improved
(please refer to https://moodle.hrsfc.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/9379/mod_resource/content/1/Improve%20your%20EPQ%20paperwork.pdf)

- More & better ways of getting & evaluating information would be helpful. Right now most of my research comes either from Docker & other companies themselves (which is /fine/, they are industry experts, but also shows some level of bias towards using docker)
- Tracking progress better could be helpful; right now diary entries are not always getting written which will I predict will cause some trouble later on
  - It may be possible to backdate /some/ stuff from commit logs, but it won't be possible to give as detailed of diary entries as I would like without writing diary entries at the time, could there be a better way to enforce writing 1-entry-per-week?
- More detail could be included in diary entries that are written now
- Better timelining could be useful; right now I have 1 timeline but making more detailed intra-month ones and updated inter-month ones could help. My project has changed a bit (see networking issues etc.), so with more information on how long stuff could take new timelines could be made
- I'm writing an artefact, so I need a commentary; something akin to this has been started in [[id:956c4043-ffaa-45d6-be32-6219c21ea597][Programming log]], but it should probably be moved into its own thing and become more detailed
