* Difference between reflection and evaluation
- Reflection simply looks back on something, and may comment on what should be done in the future /but doesn't make comments on quality/
- Evaluation makes comments on how well stuff went, but it doesn't really comment on future action

It's important to both reflect on and evaluate the EPQ continuously.
