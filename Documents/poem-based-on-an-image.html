<p>
Sky, and trees, and trees, and sky, and looking out and looking on and looking at nothing in particular.
</p>

<p>
Looking at the clouds, and the trees, and the world, and just existing.
</p>

<p>
Do you remember the last time you were just existing?
</p>

<p>
I remember the last time I was at peace, but I don't remember the last time I was existing. Just existing. Only existing. Nothing else.
</p>

<p>
A tired, suffocating, lifegiving mess of thoughts stops that in its tracks.
</p>

<p>
Are everyone's thoughts so confusing?
</p>

<p>
Are everyone's minds so full, so messy, so impossibly impossibly vast and unrelenting?
</p>

<p>
And how do I manage to pull out the thoughts I want and need at the right time?
</p>

<p>
And if you were I and I were you for just a day what would life be like and what would we know differently? How would we think differently at the end of it?
</p>

<p>
At first, when I saw us, I thought we were <a href="https://www.notion.so/Similar-7a5324b18b0940b19f41aa13dccb9738">similar</a>, and we are, so similar. But somehow, sometime, over the knowledge and the learning and the understanding and the getting to know each other I've realized that though superficially similar we are really quite different.
</p>

<p>
What goes on in your mind?
</p>

<p>
What goes on in my mind?
</p>

<p>
How do I just exist?
</p>

<p>
And do I want to?
