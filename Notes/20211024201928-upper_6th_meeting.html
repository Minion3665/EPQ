I had the pleasure of talking to some Upper 6ths about their project &amp; what they'd suggest making for mine.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately this conversation was spontaneous so I can't put a recording or transcript here, however I did compile a list of their tips.
Here are the tips they gave me.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The EP is <i>much</i> more forgiving to dissertations than artifacts
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Despite this advice I'm still going to do an artifact. Unfortunately the idea simply appeals to me far more</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pick something scalable, you need to have the possibility to finish it quickly and get more complex, rather than make something and be unable to finish it later
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="file:///home/runner/School/EPQ/Documents/process-manager-project-requirements.html">The initial specification</a> I wrote was designed to be scalable, so my project fits this <i>perfectly</i></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pick something you're very interested in, you do not want to be working on something that bores you for this long
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Luckily my project is something that directly impacts me, in a subject I deeply care about &amp; something I have wanted to do for a while</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pick something that <b>you can do research for</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Initially <a href="20211024202440-can_my_project_be_researched.html#ID-9941e505-65be-4fa0-9d2d-6dddc5c3fda1">I was worried that my project was not researchable</a>, however I've later concluded that there's a lot of research to do, I just need to make sure to document it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do not leave the EP until the end
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is an important one, I plan to schedule my time and set apart ~1-2 hours for the EPQ per-week. I'll probably do this on the weekends rather than during my free periods as I would prefer to be at home where I have dual-monitors and suchlike</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
The upper 6ths also let me add them to a microsoft teams chat room, where I will be able to contact them if I have any further questions. Thank you upper 6ths ðŸ˜„!
