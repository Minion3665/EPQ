#+title: Programming log
* Layout
- Each new problem will be under a heading, roughly in chronological order that I came across them (although problems that I anticipated and solved beforehand may be placed later, as it will be more logical and easier to read)
- If there's a problem I believed I had solved but had not, I may list it multiple times, once when I initally solved it and subsequent times when I was forced to change and improve my solution. I will mention if this is the case
- I'll rate each problem with a difficulty (1-5)
- I'll explain how I solved each problem
- I'll state how coming to this solution helped me to learn

* Building containers programatically
- Difficulty: 2
** How did I solve it?
[[https://github.com/ClicksMinutePer/process-manager/blob/097983953dc613702b9ea1a350496a0f90c4113e/containerManager/main.go#L80][This line]] sets up the command that needs to be run in order to build the container
#+begin_src go
	cmd := exec.Command("nix-build", "./containerManager/config/"+id+"/"+version+".nix")
#+end_src
and [[https://github.com/ClicksMinutePer/process-manager/blob/097983953dc613702b9ea1a350496a0f90c4113e/containerManager/main.go#L85][this line]] runs the command
#+begin_src go
	err := cmd.Run()
#+end_src
** How did this help me learn?
