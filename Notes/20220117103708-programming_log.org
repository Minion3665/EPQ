#+title: Programming log
* Layout
- Each new problem will be under a heading, roughly in chronological order that I came across them (although problems that I anticipated and solved beforehand may be placed later, as it will be more logical and easier to read)
- If there's a problem I believed I had solved but had not, I may list it multiple times, once when I initally solved it and subsequent times when I was forced to change and improve my solution. I will mention if this is the case
- I'll rate each problem with a difficulty (1-5)
- I'll explain how I solved each problem
- I'll state how coming to this solution helped me to learn

* Building containers programatically
- Difficulty: 2
** How did I solve it?

** How did this help me learn?
