* EPQ lesson notes (1h5m)
- [X] Creating a project breakdown
A project breakdown is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)][decomposition]] of tasks in the project. Issues [[https://github.com/Minion3665/EPQ/issues/7][#7]] to [[https://github.com/Minion3665/EPQ/issues/15][#15]] on github have been created as an in-order decomposition of tasks that will need to be done

- [ ] Making a project timeline
The tasks in the breakdown will need to be dated by the month I plan to complete them in, and this will need to be made into a timeline form (presumably using figma)
