* Breakdown to timeline
Yesterday I made a project breakdown, but I need a project timeline, so I'm going to be setting months for each of the major items on the breakdown. I'll then make that into a timeline in figma.

- Initial research step (November 2021)
- Initial planning step (November 2021)
- Development part 1 [Creating a basic process manager (sans-api)] (November 2021 - Janurary 2022)
  - Research (November 2021 - December 2021)
  - Development (December 2021 - Janurary 2022)
- Development part 2 [Creating an API to manage the process manager] (February 2022 - March 2022)
  - Research (February 2022)
  - Development (March 2022)
- Development part 3 [Optional depending on time] [Creating a system to manage the API, perhaps a web dashboard?] (April 2022 - June 2022)
  - Research (April 2022)
  - Development (April 2022 - June 2022)
- Deployment (June 2022 - Project end)
  - Deployment to non-critical systems (June 2022 - July 2022)
  - Deployment to critical servers (August 2022 & Beyond (It's important to note that /this step is not critical for completion of the EPQ/, which is why it can (and should if not fully ready) be pushed back past the deadline end))
- Evaluation (July 2022 - Project end)
  - Evaluation of final product (July 2022)
    - Self evaluation (July 2022)
    - Peer evaluation (July 2022)
  - Evaluation of project management (July 2022)

/This is a rough/first-draft schedule; it won't necessarily be accurate and times may be shifted around in future notes. While I have attempted to create enough scalability that if stuff takes too long there is enough I can shorten or remove (and I've not scheduled the last month so that I can overflow into that if absolute necessary), I haven't created a contingency plan for if this takes far shorter than estimated. My current idea is to create a way to get SSL certificates and reverse proxy to those containers more easily, as that is a system that will be needed anyway and will likely be developed post-EPQ./
