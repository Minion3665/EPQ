Yesterday I completed a few of the tasks I wanted to, I got up to completing part of the PPR, so that's the first thing I'm going to be focusing on today.
&#x2014;
I've now completed the PPR up until the stage where I have to (and emailed OCR for permission to publish it, as they hold the copyright to that document), and noticed that I haven't yet licensed the image in <a href="file:///home/runner/School/EPQ/Documents/poem-based-on-an-image.html">the poem I wrote based on the image</a>&#x2026; oops! My next task will be to get a license for that.
</p>

<p>
To do this, I reverse-image-searched the image using <a href="https://tineye.com/">tineye</a>, looking specifically for stock images. I then headed over to <a href="https://www.123rf.com">123rf</a> and used their free trial (10 free stock images) in order to download the image under their standard license. I'm hoping that any more stock-image usage happens within the next month, as then I likely won't have to pay for licenses to any other stock images (credits don't roll over if you cancel your plan).
</p>

<p>
Finally, I downloaded a higher-resolution version of the image and put it onto the poem page.
</p>

<p>
All other assets on my website were created by me (excluding the voice recording, which also contains Pinea, I've already asked them for permission to publush this), so I don't need to get licenses to anything else right now. I will create a new task that I would like to
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> Make a credits.org page displaying links to everything and everyone that's helped me in getting this project</li>
</ul>
<p>
I feel like this is an important addition, as I will rely on a lot of stuff in this project, and I want people to be adequately credited, cited &amp; soforth.
</p>

<p>
I'm also going to add a further quality-of-life task:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li class="off"><code>[&#xa0;]</code> Add a link back to the main page from each page on the site, as well as a link to the source on github</li>
</ul>
