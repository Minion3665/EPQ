0:00:00 Alright, so overnight I thought of a way to add links to github, so I'm going to do that quickly &amp; then start on the time-management tasks
</p>

<p>
0:03:10 I've done that, so I can mark that task as completed and start on the project-management side of things. I'm going to be using google calendar for scheduling as it's a calendar that I use for scheduling other things (such as all my lessons). I'm going to schedule 2 hours of work per week on the weekends, although I will undoubtedly use more time like that during the week in unscheduled time. 
</p>

<p>
0:17:03 <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=qgbb951tlmrgd0sm3nl1f9e67c%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe%2FLondon">Here's a link to the calendar</a>. Google took a while to create it, so while it was creating it I fixed the css for the header (making it wrap on smaller screens), next I'm going to create a kanban board using github projects (quire is nice, but using the same website for everything is nicer)
</p>

<p>
0:24:53 <a href="https://github.com/Minion3665/EPQ/projects/1">And here's a link to the kanban board</a>. As a bonus, github issues will automatically be placed on the kanban board as well as having dated history. I'm therefore going to be using them instead of org agenda checkboxes (although I might still use the checkboxes for daily tasklists). I won't be adding past tasks to the kanban board, as there's no point, but I've added all present incomplete tasks to the board.
</p>

<p>
0:28:40 I've ended the timer for now, I'll likely be returning to do more work later under a different timer. When I do, I'll probably be working on the <a href="../20211025183307-docker_vs_lxc.html#ID-8ee72434-d01f-46c9-a903-09ee8a03439c">Docker vs LXC</a> series of notes that I haven't yet finished writing up.
