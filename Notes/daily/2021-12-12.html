It has been 2 weeks since the last entry, so I've got quite a bit to catch up on

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I took a tech-week and explored some interesting technology that I've not used before; most of them (for instance <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/">I2P</a>) aren't useful for this project, but <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a> looks incredibly interesting. It can be used to <a href="https://nixos.org/#asciinema-demo-example_4">build docker images</a> (which means it is compatible with containerd), and allows far more consistency than other methods I was considering, infact <a href="https://nixos.org/#asciinema-demo-cover">the docker images can end up <i>smaller</i> than alpine linux</a></li>
<li>I did some API design with <a href="https://stoplight.io/studio/">stoplight studio</a>; I still haven't designed the full spec but I have some basic info</li>

<h2 id="org35b3fa4">What will I do over the holidays?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org35b3fa4">
<p>
I'm not going to schedule any more time than the 2 hours already set out each sunday over the holidays, and here's why:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>My mental health has been not so good, and it's getting worse. This is due to a lot too much stress, and <i>I need a break</i>.</li>
<li>I'm already doing well on my EPQ; I have the time to avoid scheduling much more time</li>
<li>I have several other projects and holiday homework that I have made commitments to complete far earlier than the EPQ; these must take priority in my scheduling</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is not to say that I won't do my EPQ more than that over the holidays, I enjoy doing the EPQ and I find it more relaxing and freeing than some other tasks I have to do, but I <i>will not</i> make a formal commitment to make any further time. I understand that this is probably not what you meant by 'create an EP Christmas holidays plan', and for this I apologise.
