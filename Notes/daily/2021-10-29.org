- [ ] Copy the PPR to documents
  - [ ] Get permission from OCR to publish PPR
  - [ ] Copy it over
- [ ] Add a link back to the main page from each page on the site, as well as a link to the source on github
- [ ] Create a schedule of when the EPQ will be done (2hrs/w to start with)
- [ ] Create a kanban board (perhaps [[https://quire.io][quire]] to start with?, or [[https://github.com/Minion3665/EPQ/projects][github projects to better integrate with the existing systems]])
- [ ] Create a timeline of when stuff should be done by, or add time estimates to the kanban board
