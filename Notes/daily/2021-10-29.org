- [X] Create a schedule of when the EPQ will be done (2hrs/w to start with)
- [X] Create a kanban board (perhaps [[https://quire.io][quire]] to start with?, or [[https://github.com/Minion3665/EPQ/projects][github projects to better integrate with the existing systems]])
- [ ] Create a timeline of when stuff should be done by, or add time estimates to the kanban board

0:00:00 Alright, so overnight I thought of a way to add links to github, so I'm going to do that quickly & then start on the time-management tasks

0:03:10 I've done that, so I can mark that task as completed and start on the project-management side of things. I'm going to be using google calendar for scheduling as it's a calendar that I use for scheduling other things (such as all my lessons). I'm going to schedule 2 hours of work per week on the weekends, although I will undoubtedly use more time like that during the week in unscheduled time. 

0:17:03 [[https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=cWdiYjk1MXRsbXJnZDBzbTNubDFmOWU2N2NAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ][Here's a link to the calendar]]. Google took a while to create it, so while it was creating it I fixed the css for the header (making it wrap on smaller screens), next I'm going to create a kanban board using github projects (quire is nice, but using the same website for everything is nicer)

0:24:53 [[https://github.com/Minion3665/EPQ/projects/1][And here's a link to the kanban board]]. As a bonus, github issues will automatically be placed on the kanban board as well as having dated history. I'm therefore going to be using them instead of org agenda checkboxes (although I might still use the checkboxes for daily tasklists). I won't be adding past tasks to the kanban board, as there's no point, but I've added all present incomplete tasks to the board.

0:28:40 I've ended the timer for now, I'll likely be returning to do more work later under a different timer. When I do, I'll be working on the [[id:8ee72434-d01f-46c9-a903-09ee8a03439c][Docker vs LXC]] series of notes that I haven't yet finished writing up.
