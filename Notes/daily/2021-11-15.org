* Diary entry
** What have I done since the last entry?
Since the last entry I've
- [[file:2021-11-03.org][Done some research on what language I should use for my project]]
- Talked to the second co-owner on what language I should use for my project
- Started work on an [[https://github.com/ClicksMinutePer/process-manager][early/test version of the project]]
- Learned about how to research & cite, [[file:~/School/EPQ/Documents/bibliography.org][created a bibliography]] which [[https://www.orgmode.org/Changes.html][will go live when I update the website's build script to org 9.5, as that's the first version that has support for citations]]
** What have I learned & how?
- I've learned how to properly cite researched work by being given resources by HRSFC
- I've learned a small amount of go by trying it out
** What worked well?
- The discussion with the second co-owner was particularly productive
** What would I do differently next time?
- I would properly cite and evaluate my sources for the research on what language to use, as that would save me from having to go back and do it later
