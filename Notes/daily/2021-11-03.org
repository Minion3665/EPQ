* Project breakdown
In the last note I mentioned creating a project breakdown, which is a decomposition of project tasks. The breakdown I made then was acceptable, but I still feel that it missed some points, so I'm going to make another one here

I'm going to break the project into broad steps, and then break each of the steps down into smaller substeps

- Development cycle
  - Research
  - Prototyping
  - Development
  - Testing
- Deployment
  - Deployment to non-critical systems
    - Sky@Pi
    - Mini'sMacMini
    - Possible DC2 deployment (DC2 is a slated server improvement, it is (as of now) unclear if it will be production critical or when exactly it will occur)
  - Deployment to critical servers
    - DC1 deployment (DC1 is the main server, currently hosting https://clicksminuteper.net. While the software running on it needs an overhaul, it's still a production-critical server)
    - Possible DC2 deployment (DC2 is a slated server improvement, it is (as of now) unclear if it will be production critical or when exactly it will occur)
- Evaluation
  - Evaluation of final product
    - Self evaluation
    - Peer evaluation
  - Evaluation of project management
