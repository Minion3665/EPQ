- [ ] Copy the PPR to documents

  - [ ] Copy it over
- [ ] Templates should be created for daily diary notes
- [ ] Go to Moodle and look at the 'Examples of projects from Hills students'.
  - [ ] Make notes on these examples
    - What are the strengths and weaknesses?
    - What can you learn from these?
    - How will this influence the way you work?
- [ ] Make a credits.org page displaying links to everything and everyone that's helped me in getting this project
- [ ] Add a link back to the main page from each page on the site, as well as a link to the source on github

As predicted, no tasks were done yesterday. Today I plan to start off by making a template for diary notes, as this is something I will need to do sooner or later (and sooner rather than later).
