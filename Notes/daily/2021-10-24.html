To start off today I've copied over the task-list of tasks I didn't complete yesterday, and I'm going to have a go at finishing as many as possible in 2 hours. It's still mostly setup/busywork, so there's not a whole lot to document, but I'll write down useful stuff here as well as make commits to the repository.
</p>


<p>
As a first task, I'm going to sort out the homepage of the website; I've decided to have the sitemap on the homepage (at the bottom so that it's easy to find links to everywhere. Other things I'll include on the homepage are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A short description of who I am, likely stolen from a private self-describing notion note</li>
<li>A short description of what the EPQ is)</li>
</ul>
