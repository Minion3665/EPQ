Initially I worried if my project could be researched. It's a development project, and I don't usually think of those as having a lot of research. They have design stages, a lot of development, a lot of debugging and testing, and then later maintenance, but I couldn't think of what the research could be.
</p>

<p>
I then realized that of course development projects <i>do</i> have research, it's just been hiding in all the other steps. Here's a few things that need research in a development project:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What language would be best to use (Exploring what libraries a language has, along with speed, extendability, update frequency, community size &amp; other factors)</li>
<li>What frameworks, libraries etc. would be best to use (Looking at the documentation for various options)</li>
<li>How to implement solutions in a given language (Stack overflow or similar)</li>
</ul>

<p>
And that's only <i>after</i> deciding to do the project. Before doing the project you may also need to research
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What existing solutions there are</li>
<li>If your problem exists &amp; needs solving</li>
<li>What ways could you sidestep your problem</li>
</ul>
<p>
There's little point in making something that nobody needs or wants after all&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
So I fully believe that my EPQ project <i>does</i> need research, a lot of it. The difficult part, of course, will be noticing when I'm doing that research and documenting it.
