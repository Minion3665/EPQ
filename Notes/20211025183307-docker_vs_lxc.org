The first thing I've decided to research is docker and LXC[fn:1]

This writeup is actually being produced by future me, because I stumbled across this rabbit hole while trying to do an unrelated task, so I can tell you now that it'll lead us on a multipart series of learning about docker, and teach us some things that I predict will be essential for the final project.

Enjoy.

Before I begin, it's worth mentioning that I do have some prior knowledge of both docker and LXC. I'm currently using LXC to manage my containerization systems currently. If you'd like to know more about the current infrastructure, I've [[id:a907489b-22b8-46e5-89fb-95319c995df3][written a note about how I currently run things]]. My father works for docker & I've used it to set up [[https://mailcow.github.io/mailcow-dockerized-docs/][an email server using mailcow dockerized]], although this doesn't involve much if any knowledge on how docker works from a developer perspective.

So, with that said let's get started:

The fiest place I went was my search engine of choice 'DuckDuckGo', with the query 'docker vs lxc'. This is due to it being a very quick way to get a lot of information which I can later check for reliability. I expected to find a number of comparison websites and articles comparing the two services. Here's what I found

* A link to the docker FAQ page, which has information on docker and LXC

* [[https://www.upguard.com/blog/docker-vs-lxc][This upguard blog article on the differences between docker and LXC and why docker is better]]

* The containerd website

* Footnotes
[fn:1] I decided to research the difference between docker and lxc as they are often-considered-to-be-similar containerization services
