Unfortunately if you're not then I won't be able to publish the projects as they are not my work &amp; I have no contact with these students, no way to get contact with these students, and no desire to ask them for permission to publish their projects. Sorry about that.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>

For each project:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What are the strengths and weaknesses?</li>
<li>What can you learn from these?</li>
<li>How will this influence the way you work?</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Making sure your project notes are readable is important; if people can't read your project they're not going to rate it very highly</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I will attempt to evaluate reliability of sources, although it may not always be relevant to do so (for example documentation will almost always be 100% reliable). Benchmarking, on the other hand, may be easier to have reliability scores</li>
<li>I will evaluate the tools, libraries etc. that I will be using based on their features and what I need them to do. An example of an evaluation for a tool is <a href="20211028204303-why_switch_from_notion.html#ID-c83a9bd1-2a46-47f7-9cec-d5b42d473eb4">this, on why I'm using org-mode instead of notion</a></li>
