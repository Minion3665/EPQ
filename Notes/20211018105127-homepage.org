#+title: Notes
This notes folder should be used as a scratchpad for ideas, as well as a place to record short bits of information that have not yet been compiled into Documents.

The daily folder of notes will be used for diary-style notes as well as short-lived notes, organized by date. It's possible these will be later compiled into documents, although they do not have to be.
